**What is Sanity?**

Sanity is a headless CMS that allows you to define your own data structure and then query it using a powerful query language called GROQ. It is a great tool for building websites and applications that require a lot of flexibility in terms of data structure and content.

**Markdown Editor.**

```ts
import MDEditor from "@uiw/react-md-editor";
```

**useActionState.**

```ts
// useActionState is a hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action
[state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initState, permalink?)

// Server actions will automatically reset the form on submission, which is nice sometimes, but also not always what you want.

```
